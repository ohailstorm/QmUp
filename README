===Project description===
This project will include positioning data from some open data source. Users will
then be able to add information about the existing places (ie. the closest
outdoor gym) via their own accounts, that will use single sign-on from either 
facebook or google. 

==Technical specification==
Initially, the project will be based upon the use of Meteor as a framework.
Partially this is because it seemed to be a very interesting way of linking the 
client-side with the server-side, but also because the server will more act as
a coordinator of other web services rather than a heavy backend.

The design of the website will be done by using components from bootstrap. The 
main reason for this is that this is one of the most used frameworks today, and 
is therefore good to have knowledge about.
