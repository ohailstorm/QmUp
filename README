===Project description===
This project will include positioning data from some open data source. Users will
then be able to add information about the existing places (ie. the closest
outdoor gym) via their own accounts, that will use single sign-on from either 
facebook or google. 

==Technical specification==
Initially, the project will be based upon the use of Django as a framework on the
server side. This is because both team members had good experiences from working
with flask and a Python-based backend in TDDD24, but it is possible this will be
changed into a php-based backend later on. 

On the client side we will use either angular.js or ember.js to begin with. 
Further investigation is needed as the design of the website is planned to be 
done by using components from twitter bootstrap. The main reason for this is 
that this is one of the most used frameworks today, and is therefore good 
to know how to work with bootstrap. The idea is also that the website design
and functionality will thereby be responsive, so that it can work well on any
device.

For the data storage (ORM )the plan is to use SQLAlchemy, which seems to be 
suitable for using with Django.
