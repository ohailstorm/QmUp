===Project description===
The project will use the soundcloud api and let users create playlists. Songs can
be added and queued but no skipping is allowed!

==Technical specification==
EDIT: This project is using the MEAN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, AngularJS, Node.js). The information below is outdated. Mongoose is used for object modeling.

=========OLD INFO======
Codeigniter will be used as the server-side framework.

On the client side we will use either angular.js or ember.js to begin with. 
Further investigation is needed as the design of the website is planned to be 
done by using components from twitter bootstrap. The main reason for this is 
that this is one of the most used frameworks today, and is therefore good 
to know how to work with bootstrap. The idea is also that the website design
and functionality will thereby be responsive, so that it can work well on any
device.

For the data storage (ORM )the plan is to use Doctrine, which seems to be 
suitable for using with Codeigniter.
