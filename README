===Project description===
The aim of this project is to create a service where the users can create events and invite their friends. Each atendee is then given suggestions on how to get to the event, based on what others have chosen.

==Functional requirements==
The user shall be able to:
- Log in with their facebook/google account
- Create an event specified with the location of the event and the time it will take place
- Invite friends to the event
- Select from where he/she will go
- See from where other users will get to the event, and when they will start their trip
- get suggestions on when the user must leave the starting location to get to the event on time

==Non-functional requirements==
- Google maps api shall be used to retrieve information about directions
- Google maps api shall be used to display the location of the event and the starting points for each user's trip.
- The server side shall be built using the Codeigniter framwork and Doctrine

==Technical specification==
The server side will be built using the Codeigniter framework. The rationale for this that it is simple to set up, but still capable enough.

On the client side we will use angular.js. The aim is to create a responsive website that will work well on any device.

For the data storage (ORM )the plan is to use Doctrine, which works well with Codeigniter.
