===Project description===
The aim of this project is to create a service where the users can create events and invite their friends. Each atendee is then given suggestions on how to get to the event, based on what others have chosen.

==Functional requirements==
The user shall be able to:
- Log in with their facebook/google account
- Create an event specified with the location of the event and the time it will take place
- Invite friends to the event
- Select from where he/she will go
- See from where other users will get to the event, and when they will start their trip
- get suggestions on when the user must leave the starting location to get to the event on time

==Non-functional requirements==
- Google maps api shall be used to retrieve information about directions
- Google maps api shall be used to display the location of the event and the starting points for each user's trip.
- The server side shall be built using the Flask micro framwork and SQLAlchemy

==Technical specification==
Initially, the project will be based upon the use of Flask as a framework on the
server side. This is because both team members had good experiences from working
with flask and a Python-based backend in TDDD24, but it is possible this will be
changed into a php-based backend or Django later on. 

On the client side we will use angular.js. The aim is to create a responsive website that will work well on any device.

For the data storage (ORM )the plan is to use SQLAlchemy, which seems to be 
suitable for using with Django.
