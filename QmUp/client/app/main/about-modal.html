    <p>QmUP is a collaborative playlist app using the <a href="http://www.sundcloud.com" target="_blank" style="color: orange;">Soundcloud</a> database. To log in you need a <a href="http://www.facebook.com" target="_blank" style="color: blue;">Facebook </a> account. When logged in, you can easily create new playlists, add songs and collaborators to it. To become a collaborator you need to be friends on <a href="http://www.facebook.com" target="_blank" style="color: blue;">Facebook </a> and also use QmUP. As a collaborator you can also add songs to the playlist, although only the admin (the creator) can decide whether or not to allow remote skipping of songs. To see further information about songs, just click the <span class="fa fa-info-circle"></span>.</p>

    <p>This app is a project in the course Advanced Web Programming given at Link√∂ping University. The Soundcloud API is used for song-interaction and the app is using AngularJS, Express, Node.js, MongoDB and Mongoose.
